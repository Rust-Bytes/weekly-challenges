# Getting Started

### Challenge Format

Each challenge consists of:

- **Problem Statement**. A description of the task to solve.
- **Test Cases**. To check if your solution works as expected.

> _Solutions/Explanations will be added soon!_

### Rust Tip

We aim to balance the challenges by sharing Rust tips in between.

Youâ€™ll find some Rust tips here and there that might impress you or prove genuinely useful.

### Features

- You can run Rust code, edit the code, and execute it directly within the platform.
- Each challenge comes with built-in tests to check the validity of your solution.

### Challenges Timeline
