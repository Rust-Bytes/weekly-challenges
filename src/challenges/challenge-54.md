### Boost Productivity with Cargo Aliases

Tired of repeatedly typing cargo run, cargo build, or cargo check? You can simplify your Rust workflow with these built-in Cargo aliases that save time and reduce keystrokes.

```rust

cargo r // Runs your project (equivalent to cargo run)
cargo b // Builds your project (equivalent to cargo build)
cargo c // Checks for errors without compiling (equivalent to cargo check)

```
